## Welcome to Remember Memory Game,

I have been exposed over past years to Alzheimers / Dementia and I never really saw anthing Tech wise used for support.
With this in mind I have decided to base my 2nd milestone project on a memory game.

Project Goals
I will create a game which is easy to use, with animals, flowers, soothing music and colour schemes that render well 
with this horrible disease.

In doing so i will try and utilise the best skills from the course notes and any other information along the way. 
Keeping it simple.


Wireframe
I created a wire frame as an outline and it changed along the way, but the main concept i kept.
